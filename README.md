This repository hosts the source code for my bachelor's thesis project: a full stack application for an online store. This project represents the culmination of my undergraduate studies, combining theoretical knowledge with practical skills to deliver a comprehensive, functional e-commerce platform.

The primary objective of this project was to develop a fully integrated online store application, showcasing my proficiency in both front-end and back-end development. The application offers a seamless shopping experience for users, complete with product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication.
